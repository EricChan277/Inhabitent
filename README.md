When creating the webpages for Inhabitent, we needed to understand how template hierarchy affected what WordPress would show which page was active. To understand this, a useful resource that showed us how the desired content would fallback to other pages if a matching one was not selected.

However, in order to use WordPress in the first place, we needed to create a server that would allow us to create a database where we would store the back-end information that we inputted. To do this, we used MAMP to create a local host server.

Once we had our server setup, we needed to choose a language to program in. For this we used PHP. An interesting part about PHP is the ability to write HTML in a PHP file, which was necessary for nesting certain objects so that we would be able to style them with SASS.

Overall, the biggest takeaway from this project is the importance of organization of files, and the extreme usefulness of nesting items together in SASS to only target specific pages for styling.
